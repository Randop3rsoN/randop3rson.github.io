<ol> 
    <li> Rooted. Rooted is a game made by a stanford student, Kongmeng where you play as a little seed exploring a little open platform world. Because the game is in beta and not as well known it is an honorable mention.</li>
   <br> <li>MInecraft.Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game that allows players to explore, create, and survive in a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world. Released by Mojang in 2011, it offers different modes like Survival, where players gather resources, craft tools, and build structures while fending off monsters, and Creative, which gives unlimited resources to freely build and experiment. The game's open-ended nature encourages creativity, with players constructing everything from simple homes to elaborate cities and even functioning in-game computers. Minecraft's community is vast, with mods, custom maps, and multiplayer servers adding endless possibilities to the gameplay. However because of the lack of players during 2024 it is an honorable mention.</li>
